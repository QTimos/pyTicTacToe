# pyTicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe GUI game made in python using pygame. Part of my Cerberus coding challenge.

To run the game just download the archive for your system from the dist directory, extract it run the executable and enjoy.
Note that the assets folder MUST be in the same directory as the executable.

To compile the binary yourself you can use:

> pip install pyinstaller

> pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=./assets/iconProject.ico main.py --name=TicTacToe
